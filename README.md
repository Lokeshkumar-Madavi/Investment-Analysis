## Executive Summary

This investment analysis shows:
1.  Males are more involved in different investment options than females.

2. Gold is the most preferred investment avenue.

3. People choose:

  * Equity for capital growth,

  * Mutual funds for better returns and diversification,

  * Bonds for assured and safe returns,

  * Fixed deposits for risk-free and fixed returns.

4. Most participants invest to secure a financially independent life after retirement.

5. The main sources of investment information are financial consultants and newspapers/magazines.

6. The average investment duration is about 3 years.

7. Most participants expect returns between 20% and 30%.

8. Age has little impact on how long people invest or what returns they expect. There is only a slight positive link between how long they invest and the returns they expect. Overall, these factors are mostly independent in this dataset.
